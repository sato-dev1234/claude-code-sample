## Comment Review Criteria

Source code comments should explain constraints affecting correctness, not design rationale.

Flag as violations:
- Design rationale (why this API/format/protocol was chosen)
- LLM generation traces (AI/Claude mentions, "Generated by" markers)
- Implementation history (belongs in commit messages)
- Conversational tone
- Redundant comments duplicating code
